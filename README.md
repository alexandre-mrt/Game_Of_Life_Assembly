# Game Of Life
## Description
This project is an adaptation of Conway's Game of Life implemented in assembly language for the GECKO4Education EPFL's board. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It consists of a grid of cells that evolve over discrete time steps based on a set of simple rules. The project leverages the GECKO4Education board to visualize and simulate the evolution of the cells.


## Features
* Interactive cellular automaton simulation.
* Real-time visualization of cell evolution.
* User-friendly interface for controlling the simulation.


## Prerequisites
* GECKO4Education EPFL's board.
* Appropriate assembly development environment and tools.
